# Signal Processing

Designed exclusively for the awearsense platform, this repository focused on building a signal processing pipeline for analyzing EEG data. The work includes developing techniques for handling awearsense signals and creating algorithms for focus detection, which are currently in progress. Machine learning methods are being explored to enhance future capabilities, aiming to advance neurotech applications and cognitive signal analysis.
